#  Clean-Architecture-and-DDD 

This program demonstrates how to develop applications based on Clean Architecture principles. It also shows Domain entities and value objects from Domain Driven Design principles. Another important aspect of this application is it follows vertical slicing architecture.

Application source code is structured into three primary packages, namely.
  * application - contains use cases, interfaces for infra layer 
  * domain - contains domain entities, domain login, value objects, etc
  * infra - contains repository, data access logic, and ports(interface) implementations.
